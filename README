C Code Prettifier
-----------------

If you have issues with the coding style consistency, like your project
deleveloper's using tabs but you're used to use spaces and you don't
want to have inconsistent code then this utility is what you might find
useful as the utility itself can do the recoding of the input file to
use spaces and/or tabs instead. Also, it can analyze the file for
consistency for using tabs or spaces only.

Hope this helps!
